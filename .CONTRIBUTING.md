## Environment Management

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/) is the suggested python environment management tool.

### First time setup

- Install uv, as described [in the uv installation guide](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/#installation).
- `uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12 3.13` # We currently support these versions.
- `uv set 3.12` # Set to your desired default version.
- `uv self update`
- `uv sync --all-groups`
- The `.venv/` directory will now be created with all project, development and documentation dependencies installed.
    - Be sure to point your IDE to the python binary appropriate for your OS in this directory.

## Code Quality Tools

- [**tox**](https://tox.wiki/)
    - Creates virtual environments for CI or local pytest runs.
        - Note that the CI does not current execute calls to the production API by default.
    - Run `tox list` or see `tox.ini` for more info
- [**pre-commit**](https://pre-commit.com/)
    - Creates virtual environments for formatting and linting tools
    - Run `pre-commit run --all-files` or see `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for more info.

> Note: Many of the tools below are run by `pre-commit` automatically, but can also be run manually if desired.

- [**ruff**](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)
    -  Also provides formatting (replacing `black`) with `ruff format . --fix`
    - Linting rules from a wide variety of selectable rule sets
    - See `pyproject.toml` for the rules used.
    - See all rules (but not necessarily used in the project) [available in ruff here](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/).
    - Run with `ruff check .`
        - Note: When using autofixing (`ruff check . --fix`), changes may be made that require running black, which can then result in needing to run `ruff check . --fix` again.
        - Consider running `black . && ruff check . --fix && black . && ruff check . --fix` to avoid this.
- [**mypy**](https://mypy-lang.org/)
    - Static type safety
    - I recommending using the [mypy daemon](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/mypy_daemon.html) instead of periodically running `pre-commit` (or `mypy` directly.).
- [**pyright**](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright)
    - Shipped with vscode by default (via the python extension `ms-python.vscode-pylance`)
    - Suggested settings:
        - `"python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "off"`
            - The pylance extension has certain opinionated type checking assertions which are clash with mypy.
            - For example, overriding an optional field to be non-optional is considered by pylance to be a type error due to the field being invariant and the parent class potentially settings it to `None`. However, by convention in the SDK, this is a forbidden pattern.
        - `"python.analysis.languageServerMode": "full"`
        - `"python.testing.pytestEnabled": true`
- [**tach**](https://github.com/gauge-sh/tach)
    - Enforces internal namespace dependency constraints. This helps avoid circular dependencies and helps ensure implementations are in a logical place.

## Code Style and System Design

- See the [python haidra style guide](docs/haidra-assets/docs/meta/python.md) for standards on code style, system design, testing, and documentation.
